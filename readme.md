Mostly useless since Alfred out of the box can do this.
But, useful as a simple example of programming Alfred?

## Repo layout

Yep this looks like java.
The traditional java repo layout supports multi-language and multi-runtime projects.

I expect the dotnet cli version to be easiest to hammer out.
I also expect the dotnet version to be excruciatingly slow.
Later, I expect I'll port it to a runtime that has a faster cold-start time on macos arm.
